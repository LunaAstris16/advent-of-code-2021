1 - 2 letters that we know are in one of 2 spots
    [use something like the letter 5 to test it and then you can test to see which one is wich]
after this process then you have 2 set in stone patterns

use the letter 6 9 0 for the next 2 bars
    6 and 9 are the exact same except for 1 bar. when compared to 0 you will have 2 different bars that 
    you get 1 is in the e position and the other is in the d position
    
    look at the number 3 this gives us a lot of information. this tells us which one one of the bars 
    in the previous logic is the d bar and also gives us the e bar

    the number 3 also gives us 2 different bars a and g if we look at the number 7 it tells us which
    bar the a bar is and the g bar because its the one that the a bar is not

list of the bars we have and the steps:
first -> get c and f from the letter one this highlights a pair of bars
secound -> look at the letter 3 compare it to the c and f bars you get the a d and g 
third -> look at the digits with 6 in them and and find the 2 bars that 1 does not have but the others do 
            this gives you d e and c
**This is where you get the first confirmed bar**
forth -> compare the d c and e from step 3 to the a d and g in step 2 and the 2 matching ones are d
